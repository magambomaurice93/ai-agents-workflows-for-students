# AI Agents Workflows Collection

This open-source repository contains a growing set of plug-and-play AI agent workflows built for practical automation. These workflows are created using **n8n**, **LangChain**, and other AI orchestration tools to showcase how intelligent agents can simplify real-world tasks.

## 🧠 Current Workflows

### 1. 🔗 LinkedIn Scraper Agent
Extracts profile and post data using the Apify API and logs high-performing posts into Google Sheets for analysis.

### 2. 📧 Email Automatic Response Agent
Monitors unread emails via Gmail, extracts the sender’s name using an AI information extractor, and can be configured to auto-generate context-aware responses using LLM prompts.

> **Use case**: Perfect for managing high email volumes, support inboxes, or creating an AI auto-reply assistant.
